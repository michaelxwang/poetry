叶芝《美人迟暮时》
麦克王译

迟暮皓首睡意浓
火旁拾书眼惺忪
慢读梦回年少时
美目盼兮影重重

几多爱情系欢娱
慕君姿色真假情
一人爱你朝圣心
爱你娇颜化愁容

俯身炉边火正旺
惆怅叹息爱无踪
漫步云端群山里
隐匿真容繁星中

When You Are Old
William Butler Yeats (1865 - 1939)

When you are old and grey and full of sleep,            
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,       
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look            
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;     

How many loved your moments of glad grace,        
And loved your beauty with love false or true,         
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,               
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;          

And bending down beside the glowing bars,              
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled                          
And paced upon the mountains overhead                  
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.
