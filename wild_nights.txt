艾米莉·狄金森《疯狂之夜》
麦克王译

Wild Nights - Wild Nights
Were I with thee
与君同享夜疯狂
Wild Nights should be
Our luxury!
疯狂长夜乐无疆

Futile - the winds -
To the heart in port -
心在港湾风无力
Done with the compass -
Done with the chart!
抛弃海图不远航

Rowing in Eden -
Ah, the sea!
泛舟伊甸爱之海
Might I but moor Tonight -
In Thee!
但愿今夜泊君旁

艾米莉·狄金森《瘋狂之夜》
麥克王譯

與君同享夜瘋狂
瘋狂長夜樂無疆
心在港灣風無力
拋棄海圖不遠航
泛舟伊甸愛之海
但願今夜泊君旁

Wild Nights - Wild Nights
Were I with thee
Wild Nights should be
Our luxury!

Futile - the winds -
To the heart in port -
Done with the compass -
Done with the chart!

Rowing in Eden -
Ah, the sea!
Might I but moor Tonight -
In Thee!
