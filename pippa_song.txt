Pippa's Song                  ［英］羅勃特·白朗寧《皮帕之歌》(五絕)
Robert Browning (1812-1889)   麥克譯

THE year's at the spring,
And day's at the morn;        四季於春日在晨
Morning's at seven;
The hill-side's dew-pearl'd;  辰時山嶺露珠新
The lark's on the wing;
The snail's on the thorn;     百靈展翼瓜牛臥
God's in His heaven--
All's right with the world!   萬物安然天上神
