饥蛾
麦克译

白蛾饥兮
食彼衣兮
彼之谓曰
将无衣矣
玉蟾之下
我固纵之
尽食其衣
遗我淑女
皎皎
    白蛾
        怜汝
            饥兮

The Hungry Moths
[Australia] Ronald McCuaig (1908-1993)

Poor hungry white moths
That eat my love’s clothing,
Who says very soon
Ye’ll leave her with nothing,
Here under the moon
I make bold to persuade ye,
Ye may eat all her clothes
So ye leave me milady,
Poor
       hungry
                  white
                          moths.
