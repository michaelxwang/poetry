年轻与年迈
蒲必达译

世界年轻时
万木着绿装
家鹅即天鹅
女孩皆女王
登靴骑快马
天涯乱游荡
热血任性流
趁此好时光

世界终老去
树木见枯黄
兴致渐阑珊
体魄不再强
蹒跚归故里
作伴病残伤
上帝发大礼
旧爱在身旁

Young and Old
Charles Kingsley (1819-1875)

WHEN all the world is young, lad, 
And all the trees are green; 
And every goose a swan, lad, 
And every lass a queen; 
Then hey for boot and horse, lad, 
And round the world away; 
Young blood must have its course, lad, 
And every dog his day.

When all the world is old, lad, 
And all the trees are brown; 
And all the sport is stale, lad, 
And all the wheels run down; 
Creep home, and take your place there, 
The spent and maimed among: 
God grant you find one face there, 
You loved when all was young.
