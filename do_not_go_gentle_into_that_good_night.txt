狄兰·托马斯《莫要温柔道晚安》
麦克王翻译

莫要温柔道晚安
年高日暮亦应燃
咆哮怒叱光之散

智叟虽知天将暗
言语不再生闪电
莫要温柔道晚安

贤人挥别哭心愿
善行本应舞碧湾
咆哮怒叱光之散

狂徒歌唱日中天
闻道已晚空悲叹
莫要温柔道晚安

哀者临终倾力看
盲瞳如彗露欢颜
咆哮怒叱光之散

我父今在悲之巅
诅咒祈福泪涟涟
莫要温柔道晚安
咆哮怒叱光之散

原文：

Do not go gentle into that good night
Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
