## The Arrow and the Song
### Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807 - 1882)

```
I shot an arrow into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For, so swiftly it flew, the sight
Could not follow it in its flight.

I breathed a song into the air,
It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For who has sight so keen and strong,
That it can follow the flight of song?

Long, long afterward, in an oak
I found the arrow, still unbroke;
And the song, from beginning to end,
I found again in the heart of a friend.
```

## 朗费罗《箭与歌》
### 麦克译

```
矢入云兮
落地无痕
逝之疾兮
其踪难寻

歌入云兮
落地无痕
目不力兮
余音难闻

况日经年
矢现橡林
歌亦安在
藏于知音
```
